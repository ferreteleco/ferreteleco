I am a telecommunications engineer with specialization in radio communications (and a thing for software development). This profile is not updated often and the repositories rarely will be more than snippets, proofs of concept or unpolished prototypes, since my major focus is on the projects I carry out at work.

## Bout me (academia) üìö

I studied a telecommunications' degree at Universidade de Vigo, followed by a Master's degree in the same university. In addition, I'm also self taught in many complementary fields such as new programming languages / techniques / stuff and being SO, GH and academic papers my major sources of information.

## Bout me (work) üíª

I started working at the Galician Research and Development Center in Advanced Telecommunications (GRADIANT) back in 2016 and since then I have carried out works in the following areas:

* Radio propagation modelling software design and development.
* Route planning and mission control for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
* Terrestrial and Satellite communications systems design and implementation.

Besides those, I'm also very into improving sofware development techniques, methodologies and automation procedures understanding and application among my teammates.

The languages/tools I'm comfortable with are mainly Python & C++ (CMake) over VSCode and Docker (call me a VSCode geek), but I can work with bash, Matlab, Mongo, (some) SQL and (some) JS (among others).

## Bout me (hobbies) ü•Å ‚öΩ ‚õ∞Ô∏è

As a brief introduction:

* The more planes, the better
* Cats person
* LOTR / GoT / Arcane Geek
* Food Lover (sugar is my gasoline)
* Sports person (Soccer, Jugger, Climbing...)
* Musician (Mainly galician folk music but also amateur drummer)
